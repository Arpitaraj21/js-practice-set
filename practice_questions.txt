🔹 Part 1: Pure JavaScript Logic Questions (Console-based)

Reverse a String
Write a function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
Example: "hello" → "olleh"

Palindrome Checker
Check if a given string is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards).
Example: "madam" → true

Fibonacci Series
Print the first n Fibonacci numbers.
Example: n=5 → 0,1,1,2,3

Factorial of a Number
Find the factorial using recursion and iteration.
Example: 5! = 120

Find Largest Number in Array
Given [4, 9, 1, 7, 3] → Output: 9

Sum of Digits
Input: 1234 → Output: 10 (1+2+3+4)

Count Vowels in String
Input: "javascript" → Output: 3

Find Duplicates in Array
Input: [1,2,3,2,4,1] → Output: [1,2]

Check Prime Number
Input: 7 → Output: true

Anagram Checker
Check if two strings are anagrams.
Example: "listen" and "silent" → true

🔹 Part 2: DOM + JavaScript (with HTML)
