...args -> it's both spread and rest operator


what's the difference between them?
-> difference is what is the challenge we are facing based on this
it changes to either spread or rest operator.



*** problem ***

1) when our functions expect individual values but our values comes 
as a pack or bunch



//  ************** spread operator **************** //

what spread operator does , it takes the group and it tries to spread 
it into the multiple values. 


when we use rest operator, it will bunch out the values in an array
